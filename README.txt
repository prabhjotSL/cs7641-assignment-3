The simplest way to interact with the code is to open up a console using `bin/console`

From there you can interact with the BlackjackExperimenter or MazeExperimenter which run value_iteration, policy_iteration, or q_learning

On top of that you can play the games individually too by calling Maze.play! or Blackjack.play!
